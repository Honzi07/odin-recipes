        <li>Syrup is made from sugar and water and cooled.</li>

        <li>The cooled syrup is mixed with the margarine and then the coconut milk powder is added. Let rest in the refrigerator for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Then we form balls from the mass, in the middle of which we can put 1-1 grains of hazelnuts or almond, but we don't have to, they are very delicious without it.</li>
